.SYNOPSIS
  Run the ReSharper code-cleanup that the CI style gate enforces - locally, before a PR.

.DESCRIPTION
  Single source of truth for the `dotnet jb cleanupcode` invocation: restores the
  pinned JetBrains tool (.config/dotnet-tools.json), builds the solution, and runs
  cleanup with the exact profile CI uses (the same profile ReSharper/Rider apply on
  save, defined in Vion.Contracts.sln.DotSettings). CI runs this script with -Verify, so
  the local cleanup and the CI gate can never diverge.

  Default (apply) mode rewrites files in place - review `git diff` and commit.
  -Verify mode additionally fails (exit 1) if cleanup changed anything (the CI gate).

  cleanupcode is noisy (Metalama + source generators); the gate signal is the exit
  code + git diff, not stdout, so this script captures cleanupcode's output and only
  shows it if cleanupcode itself fails.

.PARAMETER Verify
  CI mode: after cleanup, fail with a non-zero exit code if anything changed.

.PARAMETER NoBuild
  Skip `dotnet build` (use when the solution is already built, e.g. in CI where a
  prior step built it). cleanupcode needs up-to-date build output.

.EXAMPLE
  pwsh scripts/cleanup-code.ps1
  Clean the whole solution, then review `git diff` and commit the result.

.EXAMPLE
  pwsh scripts/cleanup-code.ps1 -Verify -NoBuild
  The CI gate: fail if the tree is not already clean.
